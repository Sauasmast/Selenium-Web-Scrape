# Selenium-Web-Scraper

This project is intended to be coding sample for the Tarifica company. This project tends to scrape a data out of the website and save it in a cvs file.

What will I need to do to run this project?
Steps:

- Git clone the repo (Repository size is pretty big because I added chromer and mozilla driver just in case. It is usually a bad practice to do so.)
- Create a virtual environment using pip virtual environment (virtualenv name_as_you_want)
- Activate the virtual environment ( source directorytovirtualenv/bin/activate)
- Once activated move to the desired folder and clone this repo 
- Go inside the cloned repo and recursively install all the dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
- Once installed open a terminal and run a command (python index.py). Make sure your are in the directory where the project is situated.

Contact me if could not get it working. Cheers. Happy Coding !!!
